In reality, this is a simple calculator app.
Possible things to do for this project in the future:
1. Use QskLinearBox instead of QskGridBox for the buttons (Might be nicer for refactoring)
2. Add a toggle button that can be used to change the theme of the calculator. Current skin is "Pastel". New skin is probably "CrazyDisco"?
3. Extend the functionality of the calculator to programmer calculator?
